Number Guessing Game
This is a simple number guessing game I tried modifying
There are two modes: Easy and Hard which is set by a mini-menu that helps to establish the two modes.
Each mode is a defined function that is imported when a mode is selected by the user.
You will get a certain amount of tries to guess the number that the code randomly generates from 1-15 or 1-30 based on the mode you chose.

It memorizes how many times you have guessed wrong.
The variable defined is "guesses" and it keeps track of those attempts to guess the randomly generated number and will show how many times you've guessed at the end of the game.
That is all the information needed to play the game so have fun guessing!
